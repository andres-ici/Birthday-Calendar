# Birthday-Calendar
This project utilizes Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web apps, and Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, to create a simple birthday calendar. The calendar displays upcoming birthdays stored in a Supabase database and is designed to be easily deployed and customized.
